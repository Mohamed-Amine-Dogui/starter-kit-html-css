Welcome to the go-to resource for kickstarting your front-end web development journey with HTML5 and CSS3. By delving into HTML and CSS, you'll gain the skills to breathe life into your web projects, creating interfaces that captivate and engage users.

## Why learn two languages HTML5 and CSS3 separately?

- Why not create a single language that combines HTML and CSS? Why isn't HTML enough?

1. In HTML, you'll use tags to describe your content - you'll write them between angle brackets `< >`.
2. In CSS, you'll use properties to apply style to HTML elements - you'll write them within curly braces `{ }`.

- But how do you apply CSS styles to HTML elements if they are two separate languages?
  The code editor in which you write code allows you to write in different languages, including HTML and CSS.

What we'll do is simply code:
1. A content file in HTML - which will have the extension `.html`;
2. And another style file in CSS - which will have the extension `.css`.

These two files will be saved on your computer. To make them communicate, all you need to do is add a single line of code in the HTML file!
Thanks to this line of code, whenever you click on your HTML file to open it and view your website in the browser, it will automatically call the CSS file.
This will allow you to admire the styling you have applied and modify it at your leisure without affecting the content.
